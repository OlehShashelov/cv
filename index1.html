            <h2>Briefly About Myself</h2>
            <li>
                <p>
                    I started my career as an ordinary employee, but due to the fact that I had free time and endless interest in everything new, I realized that I could not sit still and began to study.
                    After 2 years, I completed my master's degree at the Higher School of Business, with knowledge of the Polish language, I started a new course as a manual tester, after which I was promoted to the position of a coach in the Learning department, which gave me even more opportunities for development.    
                    Technology does not stand still and like many, I want to have an interesting job regardless of my location. That is why at the moment I have started a new English course and a JS/Front-end course. Stage 0 at RS School, the end of which will help me to move on. 
                    I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me go this way and become an experienced Frontend developer.
